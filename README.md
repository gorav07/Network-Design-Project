🖧 Network Design Project – Two Departments with DHCP Configuration
📘 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a network design for an organization consisting of two departments — IT and Accounts.
The network is configured in Cisco Packet Tracer and includes a DHCP server that automatically assigns IP addresses to clients in both departments.

🧩 Network Structure

Departments:

🖥️ IT Department

💼 Accounts Department

DHCP Server:

Located in the IT Department

IP Address: 10.10.10.100

Configured with two separate IP pools:

IT Department Pool: 10.10.10.5 – 10.10.10.100

Accounts Department Pool: 10.10.2.0 – 10.10.2.50

🧠 Key Features

Centralized DHCP configuration for automated IP address assignment

Separate subnets for IT and Accounts departments

Efficient IP management reducing manual configuration

Supports inter-department connectivity

Designed and simulated in Cisco Packet Tracer

⚙️ Technologies Used

Cisco Packet Tracer

DHCP Configuration

Static and Dynamic IP Management

LAN Switching & Routing

🖼️ Network Topology

💡 Future Improvements

Implement VLAN segmentation for enhanced security

Add ACLs (Access Control Lists) for traffic filtering

Configure router redundancy using HSRP or VRRP

Introduce DNS and Web servers for more realistic simulation

🤝 Feedback & Suggestions

I’m continuously learning and improving my network design skills.
If you have suggestions, feedback, or guidance on optimizing this topology — especially regarding security, scalability, or performance — I’d love to hear from you!
